I'm a software engineer based in Brazil who is passionate about coding, creating open-source technologies and making then more accessible.  
Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS and Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup). I also support women and non-binary developers communities.💜✨
